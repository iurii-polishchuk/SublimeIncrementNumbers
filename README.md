# Sublime Text 2 plugin: Increment Numbers

This plugin allows you to increment/decrement numbers in **Sublime Text 2**.  
It works with caret at any position of a number.  

## Usage

 * Use `ctrl+alt+shift+up` to go increment number
 * Use `ctrl+alt+shift+down` to go decrement number

## Installation

### Using Git

Go to your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory and clone the repository
using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/jnicol/SublimeIncrementNumbers "IncrementNumbers"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the Github downloads option
* Unzip/untar the files and rename the folder to `IncrementNumbers`
* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory

## Credit

Based almost entirely on SublimeVintageNumbers plugin by Ignacy Soko≈Çowski. I just tweaked it to work in Sublime's normal editing mode, whereas Ignacy's original plugin only works in Sublime's 'Vintage' mode.
